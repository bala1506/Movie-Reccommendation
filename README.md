# Movie-Recommendation
### Aims to suggest the best 5 movies according to user's choice of movies

#### Recommendation engines
As we already know a classic example, if we buy something we get recommendations of other products we can buy.
Basically the two techniques that are used in Recommendation systems are 1.Content based filtering 2.Collaborative based filtering

##### Content based filtering:
  Recommendations will be based on the charecteristics of the product(based on the content)
  eg: If a person P1 likes bread and butter; If a person P2 likes bread and jam;
      Now if person P3 likes bread then 'jam and butter' are recommended to him

##### Collaborative based filtering:
  Recommendations will be based on the behaviour of the user
  eg: If a person P1 said he likes bread,jam,butter and eggs
      If a person P2 said he likes bread,jam,eggs then it means the behaviour of person P1 and person P2 are similar and 'Butter' can be recommended to P2
